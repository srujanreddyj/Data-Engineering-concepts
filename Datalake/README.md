## Project Data Lake
---
### Problem Statement
---
Use Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. Load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. Deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.


### Introduction
-----
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and needs to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, processes them using Spark, and load the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow analytics teams to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

##### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/A/A/TRAAAAW128F429D538.json
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCAJ12903CDFCC2.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

##### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log event, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### Project Components
The project in this repository requires two files to perform ELT and Data Lake formation. Additionally one more folder to illustrate testing.
* ```etl.py``` will load data from an S3 bucket using a Spark distributed dataframe, transform it for our analytical purposes and load it in the parquet format back into S3.
* ```dl.cfg``` A Config file with all security credentials to connect to AWS services. This file must be created on a local instance. It is not present on git to mask credentionals
* ```etl_demo.ipynb``` is a record of trial processes to test individueal components of the ELT process.

### Installation and Operation
1. Develop a test notebook to perform the required operations to make a fact and dim tables
    1. Read the data from song_data and log_data
    2. Create a songs table with ```columns -- ['title', 'artist_id', 'year', 'duration']``` from songs_data
    3. Create a artists table with ```columns -- ['artist_id', 'name', 'location', 'latitude', 'longitude']``` from songs data
    4. Create a users table with ```columns -- ['user_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'gender', 'level']``` from log_data
    5. Create a time table with ```columns -- ['start_time', 'hour', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year']```
    6. To create a songs_play table, start reading songs table and join the above table with song_title, artist_name, duration, time
2. Create an IAM user with the right permissions to read and write data to/from AWS S3
    * Create a file named dl.cfg in the project folder with your your aws credentials in the following format:
       
       ```
        [AWS]
        KEY='<yourkey>'
        SECRET='<yoursecret>'
        ```
  
3. Using AWS, create an Elastic Map Reduce cluster using your prefered tool (console, CLI or SDK). Choose an installation with Hadoop and Spark and preferably a cluster of 4 total machines (1 Driver and 3 Worker nodes)
4. Create an Amazon S3 bucket as the destination store for the final output data 
5. Edit the input data and output_data variable in the etl.py file with the path of the destination s3 bucket.
6. Gather SSH information and connect to the driver node in a terminal window using putty.
7. Use SCP or git to move the files from this repository to the master node and move into that directory.
8. Check where spark-submit is present in the node using ```which spark-submit```
9. Finally, run ```/usr/bin/spark-submit --master yarn ./etl.py``` from the command line
    

### Output
The script will transform and organize data into file folders ```songs, articles, users, table, songs_play``` in the destination S3 bucket.


### Schema for Song Play Analysis
Saved to S3 are fact and dimensional tables in a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis.

Files are stored in the Apache Parquet format for high performance data IO.

This includes the following tables.
